Instrumentation Source Library
==============================
:nofooter:  // Prevent obnoxious "last modified" thing by not having footer
:source-highlighter: pygments

There are really only two files to it.  You might prefer to just cut and paste.
The header has a few useful macros worth grabbing if you go that route.  A
test/demo driver for this interface is also available.

Download
--------

The download includes a small amount of supporting stuff for compile/test.  Try
`make run_instrument_test` from the unpacked directory.
