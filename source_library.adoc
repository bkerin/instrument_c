:nofooter:  // Prevent obnoxious "last modified" thing by not having footer

There are really only two files to it.  You might prefer to just cut and paste.
A test/demo driver and build setup for this interface is also available for
download.

Download
--------

The download includes a small amount of supporting stuff for compile/test.  Try
`make run_instrument_test` from the unpacked directory.
